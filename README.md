<h1 align="center"> Analysis of the variables causing drought in Southeastern Brazil in 2020 and 2021 </h1>

<p align="justify"> 
Python meteorology project developed in Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to discover the oceanic and atmospherics causes of the dry in the Southeast Brazil in summer 2020 and 2021. Through the programation, we will read netCDF files about variables like precipitation, temperature, wind and differents indexes that can affect the rain seasons. With statistical calculations (average, anomaly and standard deviation) will be possible to analyze the conditions since 1870 and compare the current scenario with the past.

<h2> Data and Models: </h2>
  The files are from meteorology scientific monitors agencies like:
  <li> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) </li> 
  <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.gpcc.html">Global Precipitation Climatology Centre</a>
  <li> European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) </li>
  <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=form">ERA5</a>
  <li> Meteorologia UNIFEI </li>
  <a href="https://meteorologia.unifei.edu.br">Ciências Atmosféricas - UNIFEI</a>

<h2> Python libs: </h2>

```bash
pip install netCDF4
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
```

<h2> Climatological situation in 2020 and 2021</h2>
<p align="justify"> 
During this project, the studies was about the dry impacts that affected the Southeastern Brazil in the summer season (January, February and March). Since the beggining of the decade, is possible to see the negative values from wather flow in Sistema Cantareira, the main water supply system in the state of São Paulo. This scenario show the low indexes of precipitation that hit the region with the highest population density of the country.
