<h1 align="center"> Analysis of the variables causing drought in southeastern Brazil in 2020 and 2021 </h1>

<p align="justify"> Python meteorology project developed in Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to discover the oceanic and atmospherics causes of the dry in the Southeast Brazil in summer 2020 and 2021. Through the programation, we will read netCDF files about variables like precipitation, temperature, wind and differents index that can affect the rain seasons. With statistical calculations (average, anomaly and standard deviation) will be possible to analyze the variables and indexes since 1870, and compare the current scenario with the past. </p>


Data and Models: 
  The major files are from scientific monitors agency like 
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
