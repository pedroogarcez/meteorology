# meteorology
Python meteorology project developed in Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to discover the oceanic and atmospherics causes of the dry in the Southeast Brazil in summer 2020 and 2021. Through the programation, we will read netCDF files about variables like precipitation, temperature, wind and differents index that can affect the rain seasons. With statistical calculations (average, anomaly and standard deviation) will be possible to analyze the variables and index since 1870, and compare the current scenario with the past.
